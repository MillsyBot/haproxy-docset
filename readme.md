## How to generate the docset

The html, js, css and font are downloaded from [here](http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/index.html).
I remove the navabar, search box and some fixup to make them offline.

Use the script `gen.py` under the `Documents` directory to generate the right dosSet.dsidx.

There would be all.
